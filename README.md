# The Cipher Continues...

Excellent work making it this far! Now for a coding challenge:

1. Examine all code files in this repository
2. Find the mathematical equation hidden in these files
3. The formula is: ((a * b) + c) / d
4. Find the values of a, b, c, and d in the code comments
5. The result of this equation is the line number in index.js that contains your next clue
6. That line contains encoded data that will lead to your next destination

Good luck, cryptographer!
