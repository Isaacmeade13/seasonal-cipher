# The Cipher Continues...

Excellent work making it this far! Now for a coding challenge:

1. Examine the code files in this repository (index.js, config.js, and package.json)
2. Each file contains line numbers that form a mathematical equation
3. Solve the equation to find which line in index.js holds the key
4. Remove all other lines from index.js - the remaining line will reveal your next destination

Good luck!
