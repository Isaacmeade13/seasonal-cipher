# The Cipher Continues...

Excellent work making it this far! Now for a coding challenge:

1. Examine all code files in this repository
2. Hidden within these files are special numbers that form a mathematical equation
3. Solve the equation to find which line in index.js holds the key
4. That line contains encoded HTML - when decoded correctly, it will reveal your next destination

Good luck, cryptographer!
