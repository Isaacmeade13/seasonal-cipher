##  ▂ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ █  WELCOME, CODEBREAKERS OF CLASSICALMUSICHUBB  █ ▇ ▆ ▅ ▄ ▂  

Excellent work making it this far! The digital labyrinth twists and turns, demanding both cunning and skill. Now, we delve into the realm of code, where secrets lie hidden within the very fabric of logic.

##  ▂ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ █  YOUR NEXT CHALLENGE  █ ▇ ▆ ▅ ▄ ▂  

Prepare yourselves for a coding challenge that will test your ability to navigate the intricate pathways of programming.

* **Examine all code files in this repository.** This digital domain holds more than just functional scripts; it conceals a hidden truth.
* **Find the mathematical equation hidden in these files.** Within the lines of code, a formula awaits discovery.
* **The formula is:** `((a * b) + c) / d`
* **Find the values of a, b, c, and d in the code comments.** These numerical keys are scattered throughout the repository, waiting to be assembled.
* **The result of this equation is the line number in `index.js` that contains your next clue.** A single line of code holds the key to your next destination.
* **That line contains encoded data that will lead to your next destination.** Decipher its secrets, and your path will be revealed.

##  ▂ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ █  HINTS AND GUIDANCE  █ ▇ ▆ ▅ ▄ ▂  

* **Look closely at the comments.** The values you seek are hidden in plain sight, yet easily overlooked.
* **Pay attention to data types.** Ensure you're working with numerical values.
* **Use a code editor.** This will make it easier to search and navigate the files.
* **The encoded data may require further decryption.** Be prepared to employ your cryptographic skills once more.

##  ▂ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ █  GOOD LUCK, CRYPTOGRAPHERS OF CLASSICALMUSIC HUB 2 (2BS)  █ ▇ ▆ ▅ ▄ ▂  

May your logic be sharp, your intuition keen, and your determination unwavering. The path to the final password is fraught with peril, but the reward is within reach.
